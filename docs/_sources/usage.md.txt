User manual
===========

The autotag-metadata GUI is illustrated in the following figure.

![Alt text](images/layout_annotated.png)

1. Folder Selection

First select a folder that you whish to observe for file creation.

2. Activate/Deactivate

The folder will only be observed when the program is activated. It can also be tuned off any time.

When the program is running and a new file is created (`test.txt`), the current content from `raw yaml` will be written into a new file in the same folder name `test.txt.meta.yaml`.

3. metadata input

When the program is started the mask is empty and metadata must be added in the `Raw Yaml` tab. such as:

```yaml
user: John
experiment: 10
```

When the input is not valid [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), the background color will change to purple.

Elaborate examples on how a YAML file could look like, can be found in the example section of [echemdbs' metadata-schema](https://github.com/echemdb/metadata-schema/tree/main/examples).

Once you are satisfied with your input metadata, you can also edit the fields in the `Mask` tab.

4. Create template

If you intend to use the input metadata multiple times, you can store the current state into a template.

5. Load template

Load a template from a previous session.
